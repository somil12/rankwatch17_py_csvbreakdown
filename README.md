There are two directories named: raw and processed. Raw directory contains files with
random names and extension csv. Each CSV (Comma-Separated value) file has date in its
first column. Write a python script to observe raw directory for any CSV file. This script
should parse it, and push every row into another file with “yyyy-mm-dd-processed.csv”
format where the date format is for the date in first column. For Example:
2017-09-28-processed.csv will be in processed folder and contains all entries with for the
same date.
